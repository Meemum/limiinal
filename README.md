- Using the libp2p network library.

## Features We Want

- List of core features (essential).
- Optional/nice-to-have features (stretch goals).

## Tech Stack

- Rust Programming Language
- Libp2p lib
- Egui for a cross-platform web-comptabile interface

## Design and Architecture

- High-level diagrams or flowcharts (can be added later).
- How things work together

## To Do List

- Major milestones with rough timelines.
  - Milestone 1: Basic peer-to-peer communication.
  - Milestone 2: User interface prototype.
    - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Linux
    - [ ] MacOS
    - [ ] Mobile?
