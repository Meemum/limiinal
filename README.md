# Limiinal - Planning

## Project Overview
- Cross-platform peer to peer Rust client for Limiinal. Using the libp2p network library.

## Features We Want
- List of core features (essential).
- Optional/nice-to-have features (stretch goals).

## Tech Stack
- Rust Programming Language
- Libp2p lib
- Egui for a cross-platform web-comptabile interface

## Design and Architecture
- High-level diagrams or flowcharts (can be added later).
- How things work together

## To Do List
- Major milestones with rough timelines.
    - Milestone 1: Basic peer-to-peer communication.
    - Milestone 2: User interface prototype.

## Task Breakdown
- High-level tasks for each milestone.
- Who does what.
- Prioritization of tasks (e.g., P1 - Critical, P2 - Important).

## Potential Challenges


## References and Resources
- Documentation links (e.g., libp2p, Rust docs).
- Other software used.

## TODO List
- [ ] Research libp2p documentation and examples.
- [ ] Set up the project repository and initialize with Cargo.
- [ ] Implement basic peer-to-peer connection.
- [ ] Test peer-to-peer messaging functionality.
- [ ] Design initial UI/UX mockups for the chat interface.
- [ ] Integrate encryption for secure communication.
- [ ] Develop error-handling mechanisms for peer disconnections.
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality.
- [ ] Plan stretch features (e.g., group chats, file sharing).
- [ ] Update documentation as the project evolves.
